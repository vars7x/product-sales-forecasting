This project aims to predict future product sales using historical sales data. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast sales trends, which can be used to make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and supply chain optimization. The dataset contains product sales data over a specified period, and various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and predictive models are applied to enhance forecast accuracy.
